# Credit-card fraud detection with machine learninng

In this notebook, I will train an XGBoost model, a Deep Neural Network (DNN), and an ensemble of these two models to identify fraudulent credit-card transactions. The data is highly imbalance, so we use the Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC) to evaluate the model performance. The final AUPRC we archive is around 0.90.

The work is for the "Credit Card Fraud Detection" challenge on Kaggle.
